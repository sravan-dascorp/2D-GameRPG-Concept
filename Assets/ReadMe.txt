HI,


The levels are not complete nor finished and i have removed all the latest mechanisms we have added as it is confusing and creating bugs.
so this is the simplest form of the game..i will update the project after sorting and fixing the bugs and cleaning up a bit..

currently we are working on a node based dialogue manager using graphview, but for now the game uses simple index referencing,
